## Personal Statement
ECCV is recognized as the top conference in computer vision. I don't want one of the best CV conference to become a political venue.

**We all know which country should be first blamed for this war**.

So where were you when the people of Afghanistan and Iraq suffered from the invasion and slaughter of American troop? Why only stand with Ukraine, not Afghanistan or Iraq?

**I don't want ECCV becomes political propaganda machine of the western world.**
